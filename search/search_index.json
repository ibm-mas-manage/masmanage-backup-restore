IBM Cloud Pak Foundational Services \uf0c1 Resides in the ibm-common-services namespace by default: Running mas install will suffice to restore these services If using a custom ClusterIssuer for MAS, we need to backup the MAS ClusterIssuer . If using OOTB self-signed certificates, a re-install will generate a new self-signed certificate. 3. MongoDb \uf0c1 Resides in mongodb-ce namespace by default when using MongoDb Community Edition Operator: If using in-cluster MongoDb with MongoDb Community Edition Operator running mas install will suffice to create a new MongoDb service Run mongodump on the MAS database Run mongodump on the SLS database (usually this is in the same MongoDb cluster as the MAS database) 4.
